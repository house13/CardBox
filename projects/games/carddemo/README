Card Demo
---------

This is not a real game, but just a simple demonstration of how to use the
CardPanel to display cards.

Use the CardDemoViewTest application to play around with displaying cards on
the panel and moving them around and then you can transfer that code into your
own game to do card related things.

Build the demo with:

% ant

Run the viewtest with:

% ant viewtest
