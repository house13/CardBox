<p><b>Make Your Own Games</b><br>

If you are a skilled Java programmer (or just learning), you can make your
own games and host them on our servers so that others can come and play
them at any time. This is accomplished through the use of free software
libraries that we provide to handle networking and match-making which are
documented below and demonstrated in the sample games.

<p><b>Getting Started</b><br>

The first thing you probably want to do is download our sample games
and the libraries you'll need to compile your own games. This can be
obtained in one of two ways:

<ol>
<li> Download the most recent archive (<b>highly recommended</b>):<br>
<pre class="example">
&#149; <a href="game-gardens.tar.gz">game-gardens.tar.gz</a>
&#149; <a href="game-gardens.zip">game-gardens.zip</a>
</pre>

<li> Or, check out the latest version from the
<a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a> repository (<b>will
require a bunch of other complicated fiddling</b>):

<pre class="example">
git clone https://github.com/threerings/game-gardens.git
</pre>
</ol>

<p> Once you have the sample games and libraries downloaded and unpacked,
you can check out the tutorials below to walk you through building and
playing with the sample games as well as getting started on your own
games.

<p><b>Tutorials</b><br>
Here are some tutorials we've put together to help you get started:

<ul>
<li> <a href="getting_started.html">Compiling and running the sample games</a>
<li> <a href="first_game.html">Creating your own game</a>
<li> <a href="http://forums.gamegardens.com/discussion/mvnforum/viewthread?thread=51">A thread
discussing the Presents distributed object architecture</a>
</ul>

<p> Presently there aren't many tutorials, but we'll be adding more as we
have time and if you want to write your own, we encourage you to do so.
Post them to the forums and we'll link to them here.

<p><b>Example Games</b><br>
Two games are included with the main distribution as well as a skeleton
"sample" game. Many of the games uploaded to the site come with source
code and also serve as good examples:

<ul>
<li> Dugi: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dugi-gg">http://sourceforge.net/projects/dugi-gg</a>
<li> Tasty: svn://samskivert.com/games/trunk/tasty
<li> Tall Tales: svn://samskivert.com/games/trunk/talltales
</ul>

<p><b>Libraries and Documentation</b><br>

Gardens system and sample games are provided here:
