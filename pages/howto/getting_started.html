<p><b>Building and Playing the Sample Games</b><br>
You should have the sample games downloaded and unpacked. If you haven't
done that yet, you can download the necessaries from <a href="/howto/">the
main tutorial page</a>. This will be a directory tree looking something
like the following:

<pre class="example">
games/bin - various scripts
games/lib - various jar files
games/atlantis - one of the sample games
games/sagashi - another of the sample games
</pre>

<p> You will need <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> installed to
build the sample games and, of course,
<a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a> as well. Note that JDK 1.5 is
required to build and run the games.

<p> Change into the <code>atlantis</code> directory and build the game:

<pre class="example">
cd games/atlantis
ant dist
</pre>

<p> The server is also run from ant, like so:

<pre class="example">
ant server
</pre>

<p> In another terminal window, run a client as username
<code>laurel</code> (or pick any username you like, it doesn't matter):

<pre class="example">
cd games/atlantis
ant -Dusername=laurel client
</pre>

<p> And in yet another terminal window, run a second client:

<pre class="example">
cd games/atlantis
ant -Dusername=hardy client
</pre>

<p> You should now be logged into your own multiplayer game server with
two clients and you can create a table and play a fine game of Atlantis
against yourself.

<p> You can compile and play the <code>sagashi</code> sample game in the
same way though it can be played by only one player.
