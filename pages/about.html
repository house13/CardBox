<p> Game Gardens was created by the scurvy developers at
<a href="http://www.threerings.net/">Three Rings Design</a> to foster
experimentation in online game development. This was something we wanted
to do for a number of reasons:

<ul>
<li> Though Java and Flash have done a great deal to enable the
development of simple single player games, multiplayer games tend to
require an always-operating server, at least for match-making and
frequently for running the server-side of a game. While there are free
web hosting sites, there are no free game hosting sites (that we know of).
<br><br>

<li> Making any multiplayer game requires a bunch of work that has little
or nothing to do with the game design but stands in the way of someone
getting their idea turned into code. Being firm believers in (and users
of) open source, we realized that the toolkit we'd written to save
ourselves that trouble is exactly the sort of thing that makes a perfect
open source project and we jumped at the chance to share it with the
community.  <br><br>

<li> With these obstacles lessened, we feel that many more ideas will make
their way into code, and with an audience to appreciate and give feedback
on those ideas, they may even evolve into really fun games.  At a time
when everyone in the industry is lamenting a lack of originality and
wishing developers and publishers would take more risks, we are hoping to
plant the seeds (pardon the pun) of innovation in this small way and do
what we can to smooth the path for new game ideas to be born and grow.

</ul>

<p> We'll get down off our soapbox now, but please, take a look around,
play some of the games, and then dig on in and <a href="/howto/">make your
own!</a> Please post to the forums or email <a

have questions.
