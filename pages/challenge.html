<p>
The Game Gardens Challenge is a chance for you to show off your chops as a budding game developer and possibly win some money in the process, not to mention the admiration and respect of your peers.
</p>
<p>
Your Challenge, if you choose to accept it, is to use the Game Gardens game toolkit to create a game that runs on the Game Gardens website and publish the source code so that other aspiring game developers may learn from and be inspired by your creation. Our panel of judges (made up of indie game loving industry professionals) will then judge your games on three main criteria (in order of importance):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>quality of implementation (is your code any good?)</li>
    <li>quality of interface (is it easy to play?)</li>
    <li>quality of design (is it fun?) </li>
</ul>
<p>
It is not a requirement that your game be a totally original design ("there is no new thing under the sun" after all), but if you base it on an existing game design, you should be adding an interesting twist or interpretation that is of your own making.
</p>
<p>
The Game Gardens libraries provide a networked, multiplayer game toolkit, so we encourage you to make use of that functionality and make a multiplayer game, but that is not a requirement. 
</p>

<p>
We will also be carefully scrutinizing challengers' code, and promising entrants will be invited to interview for an internship (or full-time) position at Three Rings. If you want to work at one of the most exciting and frontier exploring indy game companies, this is a great way to let us know.
</p>
